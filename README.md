Reviews and inspections are methodologies that assess the deliverables of a project. This envolve inspect the software to find out errors, omissions and verify whether the quality standards have been achieved. To assure that the test will be effective is necessary skilled professionals to execute this activities with the correct methodology in a suitable environment and with the right automation tool. The fewer defects we get on software cheaper will be the maintenance in the future. The testing process used to have conditionals to evaluate the application. We have the Regression Test technique that can be used with the support of an automated tool. The tool Easy Test was developed thinking in deliver automated test for reports developed thought JasperReport plataform in the way that this subject commonly is forget by test literature and by testers. This tool enable to create a new perspective of test for these outputs and not only focus in the regular test like data input validation allowing a rapid feedback for a set of test cases that cover functional requirements for reports.
